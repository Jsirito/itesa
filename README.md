# ITfit

Workout PWA that uses Machine Learning to identify pretrained poses, count repetitions and save the results in a User profile.
Also there is a “Sumar Puntos” (Earn points) section that uses AR to scan bottles, render the company logo and add points to the User. It was developed to scan Cocacola and Gatorade bottles.
The App is developed as mobile first so, at the moment, it works better on mobile.
